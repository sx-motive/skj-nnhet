Hello and welcome. The "Skjønnhet" project is the homepage of the ecommerce of the body cream theme with an emphasis on animation and design.

## Languages

This project is built on pure [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with the [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) builder. Almost all animations were written from scratch, for smooth scrolling was taken [locomotive scroll](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll).

<br>

also I used my own "AnimaView" npm package for split text and animate it on scroll, you can explore more about on [the AnimaView page](https://github.com/sx-motive/anima-view)
